 # File Helper Class in C++

## Introduction

The `file_helper` class is a C++ class that provides a comprehensive set of functions to manipulate files and directories. It offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for developers to perform various file operations without having to deal with the underlying complexities of the C++ standard library.

## Installation

To use the `file_helper` class, simply include the following line in your C++ source file:

```c++
#include "file_helper.hh"
```

## Basic Usage

### Creating a File Helper Object

To create a `file_helper` object, you need to specify the path to the file or directory you want to work with. Here's an example:

```c++
file_helper file("path/to/file.txt");
```

This will create a `file_helper` object that represents the file located at `path/to/file.txt`.

### Checking if a File Exists

You can use the `exists()` method to check if a file or directory exists. Here's an example:

```c++
if (file.exists()) {
  // Do something with the file
} else {
  // File does not exist
}
```

### Creating a File

To create a new file, use the `create()` method. Here's an example:

```c++
file.create();
```

This will create a new file at the specified path. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

### Deleting a File

To delete a file, use the `remove()` method. Here's an example:

```c++
file.remove();
```

This will delete the file at the specified path. If the file does not exist, it will do nothing.

### Reading a File

To read the contents of a file, use the `read()` method. Here's an example:

```c++
std::string content = file.read();
```

This will read the entire contents of the file and return it as a string.

### Writing to a File

To write content to a file, use the `write()` method. Here's an example:

```c++
file.write("Hello, world!");
```

This will write the string "Hello, world!" to the file. If the file does not exist, it
